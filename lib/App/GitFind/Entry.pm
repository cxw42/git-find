=head1 NAME

App::GitFind::Entry - Abstract base class representing a file or directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This represents a single file or directory being checked against an expression.
Concrete subclasses implement various types of entries.

=head1 MEMBERS

=head2 searchbase

Required L<Path::Class::Dir>.  Results will be reported relative to this
directory.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

# }}}1

=head2 isdir

Truthy if it's a directory; falsy otherwise.
Must be overriden by subclasses.

=cut

sub isdir { ... }

=head2 name

Basename of this entry.
Must be overriden by subclasses.
TODO May be a string or a Path::Class instance?

=cut

sub name { ... }

=head2 path

Full path of the entry with respect to L</searchbase>.
Must be overriden by subclasses.
May be a string or a Path::Class instance?

=cut

sub path { ... }

=head2 abs_path

Absolute path of the entry.
Must be overriden by subclasses.
May be a string or a Path::Class instance?

=cut

sub abs_path { ... }

=head2 pathclass

Returns the appropriate L<App::GitFind::PathClassMicro> subclass
of L</path> based on L</isdir>.

=cut

sub pathclass {
    require App::GitFind::PathClassMicro;
    return $_[0]->isdir
        ? App::GitFind::PathClassMicro::Dir->new($_[0]->path)
        : App::GitFind::PathClassMicro::File->new($_[0]->path);
} #pathclass

=head2 prune

If this entry represents a directory, mark its children as not to be traversed.

If this entry represents a file, no effect.

=cut

sub prune {
    ...
}

=head2 BUILD

Enforce abstractness, and the requirement to provide a C<searchbase>.

=cut

sub BUILD {
    my $self = shift;
    croak "Cannot instantiate abstract base class" if ref $self eq __PACKAGE__;

    croak "Usage: @{[ref $self]}->new(-searchbase=>...)"
        unless $self->searchbase;
    croak "-searchbase must be a App::GitFind::PathClassMicro::Dir"
        unless $self->searchbase->DOES('App::GitFind::PathClassMicro::Dir');
} #BUILD()

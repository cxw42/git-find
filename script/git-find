=head1 NAME

git-find - Find files anywhere in a Git repository

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    git find [SWITCHES] [REFS] [--] [EXPRESSION]

This command searches for files satisfying the C<EXPRESSION>, a la find(1),
anywhere in a Git repo.  Unlike find(1), the search scope is the whole repo
(for the C<REFS> you specify) regardless of the current directory.

For more help, run C<git find --help> or C<git find --man>.

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

Quick reference:

=over

=item Switches:

Help (-?, --usage; -h, --help; --man); Version (-V, --version);
Verbosity (-v); Warnings (-W).

=item Refs:

Anything accepted by git-rev-parse(1)

=item Expression:

Anything accepted by find(1), plus -ref/-rev

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Switches

These are options controlling the overall behaviour of git-find.  They may
not be interleaved in with the L</Expression>, if one is given.

=over

=item B<-?>, B<--usage>

Print a brief usage reminder

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print basic help

=item B<--man>

Show full help (equivalent to C<man git-find>)

=item B<-u>

Unrestricted search.  Normally, git-find does not search ignored files.
When this option is given, it does search those files.  However, it still
skips C<.git/> directories.

=item B<-v>

Increase verbosity.  May be given multiple times.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print version information and exit

=item B<-W>, B<-Wname>

Enable warning B<name>, or all warnings if no B<name> is given.

=back

=head2 Operators

In the L</Refs> or L</Expression>, you can specify multiple items joined by
logical operators.  They are listed below in order of descending precedence.
Each operator must be separated by whitespace from any adjacent parameters.
Operators short-circuit.

=over

=item B<( )>, B<[ ]>

Grouping.  Parentheses and brackets are interchangeable.

=item B<-not>, B<--not>, B<!>, B<^>

Logical negation.

=item B<-a>, B<--a>, B<-and>, B<--and>, B<&&>

Logical and.  This is the default operator between terms if no operator
is given.

=item B<-o>, B<--o>, B<-or>, B<--or>, B<||>

Logical or

=item B<,>

Sequence: separates items to be evaluated separately.

=back

=head2 Refs

By default, git-find searches the current index (cache).  This is the same
as the default for git-ls-files(1).
You can specify one or more refs to search using any of the forms described
in L<gitrevisions(7)|https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions>.

You can specify the special value C<]]> (a double right bracket) to search
the working tree that is currently checked out.
(Mnemonic: search I<right> here.)  If you have an actual ref called "]]",
git-find won't be able to help you.  Sorry!

    TODO? You can specify multiple ranges of refs separated by C<-o> (or its
    equivalent forms given in L</Operators>) or C<,>.  Comma is treated as
    equivalent to C<-o> when separating refs.

=head2 Expression

The expression includes one or more elements separated by L</Operators>.
Elements can be options, tests, or operators.

Elements of expressions can be specified in a form similar to find(1).
Long elements (e.g., C<-name>) can start with a single or a double dash.

Tests are of two types:

=over

=item Index tests

These are tests that only require information from the git index, such
as the name of the file and whether it is executable.  They are (at least on
Unix-like systems):

C<-cmin>, C<-cnewer>, C<-ctime>, C<-empty>, C<-executable>, C<-false>, C<-gid>,
C<-group>, C<-ilname>, C<-iname>, C<-inum>, C<-ipath>, C<-iregex>,
C<-iwholename>, C<-level>, C<-mmin>, C<-mtime>, C<-name>, C<-nogroup>,
C<-nouser>, C<-path>, C<-readable>, C<-regex>, C<-size>, C<-true>, C<-type>,
C<-uid>, C<-user>, C<-wholename>, C<-writeable>

    TODO also -links, -lname, -perm, -samefile, -xtype?

=item Detailed tests

All tests other than index tests may require
checking out a worktree with one or more of the given refs.
Therefore, they may be much slower than name-only tests.  However, if the only
ref given is C<]]> (working directory), detailed tests can be executed without
checking out a worktree, so the slowdown is not as bad.

=back

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM FIND(1)

In git-find but not in find(1): -ref, -rev

In find(1) but not in git-find: find switches; TODO -xtype, -context?

=head1 WARNINGS

If the C<-W> option is given, warnings are enabled.  Possible warnings are:

=over

=item B<-Wdetailed>

Warn if a detailed test is used on a search scope other than C<]]> (the
current working tree).
